Call to discuss the logistics. There are precious few options in Manhattan for true One Bedroom condos in this price point, and the J line at the Greenwich Place Condominium is always a popular choice. Their appeal is broad, they fit the budget for both studio and 1BR buyers, also both investors and owner-occupiers looking for an alternative to renting. 11J is a super-efficient and modern home with great south and west light in a prewar building that underwent a gut renovation in 2006. It features 10' 6 high ceilings, over-sized windows, central a\/c, and elegant light oak flooring, that has a classic feeling.The highly functional layout allows for many furniture placement options. Its kitchen is open, yet tucked neatly into the corner of the living space, and features a Bosch gas range, Liebherr refrigerator, Bosch stainless dishwasher, greystone back-splash, and dark stone countertops.The bathroom is sleek and spare, its tiles in satiny white glass and sandstone, a white porcelain sink, dark stone flooring, and a deep tub with a frameless glass shower. The floating vanity, and illuminated mirror\/medicine chest and Lutron lighting with a dimmer switch create a clean, modern atmosphere. The private bedroom faces south onto quite Carlisle Street and offers bright sun for most of the day. The room will accommodate a queen-sized bed, (or even a king if you skip a night table) and its tall closet offers ample storage space. Additionally, there is a large hall closet for linens.Residents at 120 Greenwich Street enjoy a full-time Doorman, 24\/7, Fresh Direct cold storage, live-in super, well-equipped gym, large laundry room, and a landscaped, furnished roof deck. The building is Pet-Friendly, and the western-FiDi location is ideal for access to the Hudson River Parks, transportation (PATH, every subway except the F\/G) and shopping: literally across the street from Westfield WTC mall, The Fulton Transportation Center, Eataly, and an 8-minute walk to the Tribeca Whole Foods.

Sales Gallery Address: 2465 Broadway b\/n 91st & 92nd streets This four bedroom home is graciously appointed with 9'-5'' ceilings, generously proportioned living spaces, and four full bathrooms. Northern and southern exposures bathe this residence in natural light while the 7'-1\/2'' wide plank oak floors bring an air of modern elegance throughout the home. Opening to the large chef's kitchen, you are greeted by clean, white, polished quartz counter tops with a seamless waterfall edge on the massive island. Sleek grey glass cabinetry surrounding the island perfectly complements the white quartz. The cabinetry above the stovetop is framed by a striking Calacatta Novus quartz trim which flows into the quartz slab backsplash. Chic, yet functional, the kitchen is complete with an integrated Bosch appliance package including 30' full-height refrigerator and 18' freezer columns, Thermador wine refrigerator, and polished chrome Watermark fixtures. Closed off from the living space, the master bedroom is soaked in natural light thanks to the south-facing oversized window looking over the beautiful elevated terrace below. With a large walk-in closet and a five-fixture bathroom, the master suite is truly an oasis. The master bathroom features Gris de Savoie tile flooring with radiant heat, while Dolomite tile adorns the walls. A semi-recessed, edge-to-edge medicine cabinet with a 10' shelf underneath tops the double vanity with polished chrome Dornbracht fixtures, while the custom light fixtures elevate the space. The Gris de Savoie honed mosaic tile flooring in the large, glass-enclosed shower echoes the larger tiles in the rest of the bathroom. This residence comes complete with Bosch washer and dryer units. Located at 212 West 95th Street, Dahlia is a 20-story new construction building with a modern, refreshingly original design by CetraRuddy Architecture. Dahlia offers 38 two-, three- and four-bedroom homes, including penthouses that are forward-thinking and elegant, just like the flower for which they are named. Amenities include a massive 5, 100 square foot elevated terrace with a lounge area for adults and a play structure for kids, a music room, a fitness room with a yoga studio, 24-hour attended lobby, a children's playspace, a lounge, a game\/tween room, a pet spa, private storage for purchase, bike storage and a covered parking garage offering 12 parking spaces for purchase. The Upper West Side is often called the most New York of all New York neighborhoods and for good reason. Culture, cuisine and shopping can all be found here, while the area's abundant greenspaces foster connection and activity, from bike riding to people watching to an early morning workout. But the real reason people choose to settle in this abundantly diverse area is because it fosters an incomparable sense of community not felt anywhere else in the city and Dahlia is in the heart of it all.
